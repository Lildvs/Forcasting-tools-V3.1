The labor market remains strong with unemployment at 3.7%, and while inflation has been a concern, it has been gradually decreasing from its peak. GDP growth has been positive in recent quarters, and consumer spending remains resilient. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy, while restrictive, has managed a soft landing scenario so far. Various economic forecasting models from institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have reduced their recession probability estimates for 2023. While some sectors show weakness, overall economic data does not currently support NBER declaring a recession for 2023.",

Inflation has been cooling from its peak but remains above the Fed's 2% target. GDP growth has been positive, with Q3 2023 showing a 4.9% annualized rate. Leading economic indicators suggest slowing but not contractionary conditions. Consumer spending has remained resilient despite higher interest rates. While some sectors like manufacturing and housing show weakness, services sector remains strong. The yield curve inversion, historically a recession predictor, has been present but other indicators contradict recessionary signals. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy has been restrictive but appears to be achieving a soft landing scenario. Most economic forecasts from major institutions have lowered recession probabilities for 2023."

The virus has been spreading in US dairy cattle since late 2023, with increased human exposure through farm workers. While transmission to humans remains rare, the first US human case was already confirmed in April 2024 in a dairy worker in Texas. The CDC has reported finding H5N1 genetic material in milk, and human exposure continues through the dairy industry. Surveillance has intensified, increasing the likelihood of detecting cases. Given the ongoing outbreaks in cattle and poultry, and the precedent of one case already in 2024, there is a substantial chance of at least one more confirmed case before year's end.",

The CDC confirmed the first US human case of H5N1 in a Texas dairy worker in April 2024, who experienced conjunctivitis as the primary symptom. The virus continues to spread, with infections detected in dairy herds across multiple states. While human-to-human transmission remains rare, farm workers and others in direct contact with infected animals have increased exposure risk. The CDC has found H5N1 genetic material in retail milk samples, though properly pasteurized milk remains safe for consumption. Enhanced surveillance protocols have been implemented by health authorities, which increases the likelihood of detecting cases. Current virus strains show limited adaptation to humans, with most infections resulting in mild symptoms. However, the ongoing outbreaks in US dairy cattle and poultry farms continue to create opportunities for human exposure."
